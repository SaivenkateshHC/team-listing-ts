# User Listing App with Search (React, Typescript, Jest, Firebase)
This project is a simple user listing page built with React, Typescript, Jest for testing, and deployed to Firebase. Users are fetched through an API. It allows users to search for other users.

## Features:
- Lists users fetched from an API.
- Provides a search bar to filter users based on criteria.
- Built with Typescript for improved type safety.
- Unit tests written with Jest to ensure functionality.
- Deployed to Firebase for easy hosting and access.

## Development Time: 
Approximately 2 hours 45 minutes.


## Getting Started -  Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
